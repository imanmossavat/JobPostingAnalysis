context of this assignment building software refers to the process of compiling and linking cpppp code: compiling a cpppp file creates an object file (obj) linking one or more object files creates a dynamic load library (dll) or an executable (exe) definition: a deterministic build is a build that when repeated produces binary identical obj and dll exe files on the windows operating system using the microsoft compiler and linker the build is not deterministic this is due to among others the presence of timestamps in the binary files problems of a nondeterministic build problem: unnecessary long link times when linking d the linker produces two output files: the dll file ddll this file will be loaded at runtime and contains all the object files that were linked into it the dll import library dlib the import library is a small static library that provides the same public interface as ddll a dll or exe p that references a function provided by d must link dlib when at runtime p calls a function f in dlib the import library loads ddll and redirects the call to the implementation of f in ddll this setup decouples p from the implementation of the public interface defined in dlib at runtime the only requirement for p is that there exists a ddll that implements the interface of dlib the mri sw build utility (called mrmake) provides an incremental build: after a change in source code only the binaries that are affected by the change will be rebuilt for example a change in a cpppp file results in recompilation of one of the object files linked into d assume that the change does not affect the interface of d in this case mrmake must relink ddll there is no need however to relink p after all the interface of ddll (captured in dlib) is not changed in today’s reality however mrmake will also relink p because: relinking d produces a new ddll and dlib although the interface of dlib did not change the new dlib is not binary identical due to the nondeterministic behavior of the build mrmake notices the changed dlib and decides to relink p mrmake detects that dlib has changed by computing its digest and comparing it with the digest of dlib computed during the previous linking of ddll a digest is a 64bit hash of the file content the used hash function makes it extremely unlikely for two different files to have the same digest the above described relinking of p also applies to other users of d if those users themselves are dlls then the relinking propagates recursively to the root of the dll dependency graph (ie to the exes) in a large sw system like mri relinking a lowlevel dll can result in dozens of dlls and exes to be unnecessarily relinked this results in long build times and severely hampers the productivity of sw engineers problem: unnecessarily large patch set a patch set contains the delta between two software baselines n and k an mri scanner that is installed with baseline n can be upgraded to k by installing the patch set this incremental installation significantly reduces installation times computation of the delta is done by comparing the digests of the dlls exes in the n and k due to the nondeterministic behavior of the build this will result in the patch set to contain all dlls exes this defeats the idea of incremental installation proposed solution clearly we cannot change the behavior of the used compiler and linker we can however change the way in which mrmake computes the file digest the idea is to implement digest functions for dll exe and import lib files that are fully aware of the format of these files this allows these functions to exclude from the digest computation those parts of the file that are irrelevant for example timestamps can be excluded from digesting this will result in identical digests for binary files that are not binary identical but that are functionally equivalent ie that are interchangeable in the above example this will tell mrmake that there is no need to relink p because the digest of dlib will not change assignment the student will investigate the feasibility of the proposed solution to this end the student must study the pe coff file format and semantics of windows exe dll and lib files study the relation between compiler and linker options and the content of these files use this knowledge to discern relevant from irrelevant information in these files use this knowledge to implement prototypes of the proposed digest functions thoroughly test the implemented functions: equal digests must imply that the binary files are interchangeable (ie are functionally equivalent) if tests are successful: productize the prototypes and integrate the implemented functions in mrmake if tests are not successful: search evaluate and recommend alternative solutions write a report with a detailed description of concepts data structures and algorithms,,2018-10-11 00:00:00.000,0.0,D455FF2A-5D57-4971-A18B-30177E54ACEF,2018-10-11 12:28:34.493,2024-05-03

over 1700 employees and is one of the fastest growing companies in europe our organization is mostly based on two groups: development and operations the development department is oriented at developing firstclass electronic mechanic and software solutions the operations department is responsible for production assembly testing and lifecyclemanagement of electronic products and systems in the range of 1 to more than a million pieces per year the software department of technologies is divided in an embedded and application software team the application software team develops applications to support ’s internal processes and also for clients assignment create an application that automatically generates incircuit tests for discrete active components this includes: study the discrete active components to be tested define which characteristics of the components must be tested research the available techniques to test these components establish boundaries and assumptions define the tests to be performed on each discrete active component to be checked map the printed circuit board assemblies to be tested into graphs create  search for algorithms to optimize the graph representation assess to viability of testing each discrete active component generate the tests if possible and provide relevant feedback for testing engineers and designers required competences: ical engineering computer science expected deliverables: prestudy document thesis report document plugin to be implemented on the tdt tool qualification of the plugin in order to verify the correct operation of electronic boards different types of tests are available each of them with its advantages and drawbacks for example the boards can be analyzed visually to look for missing components broken ones or misaligned but this type of test does not often detect components with wrong values another alternative is to perform a functional test to check whether the behavior of the whole system or a subsystem is satisfactory or not the issue in this case is that to treat the board as a black box makes more difficult to detect defects when the outputs are not the expected ones then there exist electrical tests that aim to check the functionality of discrete components in the boards this technique is called incircuit testing and it is performed ideally by measuring each individual component in an unpowered board whenever a defect is detected the root cause can be easily detected the problem in this case is that often the access to every individual component is not possible for the measurement devices and even if it is other components connected to the board can influence the test given the context explained before the main goal of the project is to create a proofofconcept application that can generate incircuit tests for discrete active components used in ’s products to carry out this project pnjunctions must be analyzed first and specially the methods to test them then the discrete components will have to be considered as part of a complex circuit with many interconnected devices that might influence the test in this way the influence of the electrically connected components must be assessed in order to evaluate possible deviations in the expected measurement and the risk of damaging hardware in the board to conclude once the tests are confirmed to be safe and feasible they will be generated by the software all the previous steps will be as general as possible in order to provide flexibility to the application and minimize the required human interaction at the same time the hardware to perform the test will be based as much as possible on the characteristics of the automated ical test (aet) machine manufactured by important note: all our

graduation project to improve your backend development skills you already know a bit about python or at least another backend languages and created a websites you're now ready to take it to the next level under expert guidance of experienced backend developers the project the project you'll be working on is nl: a cloud based geodata platform where clients use our api to connect their webshop or application with our database of geodata (streets postcodes streetnumbers coordinates and so on  you get it) you'll be concentrating on extending our datasets that currently include the following countries: nl be de lu and fr to a broader array of countries after that you'll expose the data through the api you'll need to write new api calls and tests for this to happen within your internship we'll ship this new feature to our users exiting it's a great feeling knowing your new code will be created today and used (and field tested) tomorrow in a new release everything should be tested really well and working on a big scale to help us with that we build infrastructure on the google cloud platform we provide our users everything they need to create their great apps the company our ambition at is to include the whole of eu (and more) at the end of and be the no 1 player in the eu we're already the no 1 player in nl we're a team of 15 software developers based in (within the creative industry area ) and remote (    ) the team has a focus on software quality which is reflected in the way we work we let gitlab ci perform automated tests and linting then code review each others code before deploying anything in production hard work requires good food therefore we provide free lunch with freshly baked bread at the office like our saas platforms are made for an international audience we're happy to work with talented international students covid19 before covid19 came along we served more than 1000 customers and about api calls per day from our api nl at the moment we've more than quadrupled and growth continues we now (january ) serve 5 million api calls a day due to increased online buyingas a team we were already used to working online a lot so except for the fact we're not sharing a drink together every now and then workwise everything remained similar daily standups through video conference code review through gitlab and so on you're free to choose whether to work in the office or from home we agree on goals together you figure out what works best for you to achieve them with or without covid19 that's our guiding principle what we offer challenging project (we adjust the project to match your skills) exceptional learning possibilities (daily mentoring) work satisfaction (your code in production within months) a nice internship remuneration (and double if you also graduate here) what you'll gain we apply the latest methodologies in our work daily standups sprint and planning meeting every two weeks you'll experience it all we love writing high quality code we expect you to already write code code and we help you to get even better at it we expect you to play with the latest technology and share your experiences just as we all do that's how we keep everything fresh within the project too (python 39) 99% code coverage using pytest api built using flask and sqlalchemy because of our daily standups daily mentoring our intensive code review process you'll not be left lingering alone we'll challenge you during those 5 months and try to get you from being a good programmer to a great one ask any previous intern this is the internship where they've learned the most (we promised no harm if they stated otherwise) your skills  you just love programming you didn't stop when the required school assignments were completed but at least have a hobby project to show as well we'd love to discuss that project's architecture and code with you  you're a selfstarter you're not the type who waits until the 'boss' asks you to do something especially in these covid19 times where you may work at home all day you have to be able to motivate yourself you have a plan know why you're doing this and you know how you'll be achieving it it's fine to have a preference for either frontend or backend development but we do encourage the fullstack developer attitude it just works better if you can understand your coworkers who might be specialized in the other area or you can make some small tweaks yourself so are you ready to improve our platform and your own skills apply or get more info please apply through email ( ) and include the following:  your motivation (please don't send me one of those generic motivations that apply to any company i'd love to read what you'd like to achieve with us in relation to what you

graduation project to improve your frontend development skills you are already familiar with javascript and have created some nice websites before you're now ready to up your game to the next level under expert guidance of experienced developers the project the project you'll be working on is nl: a cloud based geodata platform where clients use our api to connect their webshop or application with our database of geodata (streets postcodes streetnumbers coordinates and so on  you get it) if you lived in the for a while it's pretty certain you've already used our service (without knowing) when you ordered something online filled in only your postcode and streetnumber so the website would automatically tell you what street and city your parcel will be shipped to you'll be working on renewing our website with new functionality that we're about to reveal (a new api supporting many more countries and languages) to our customers it's a combination of a structural overhaul as well as a visual overhaul we pride ourselves in being developer friendly most of our customers are technical people who need to implement our api in their webshop so they just love example code good documentation and most of all a very appealing demo to become enthousiastic about using our services most of the work is frontend development wrestling with webpack and maintaining a small nodejs backend that's attached to the project for handling email forms server side rendering and such the company our ambition at is to include the whole of eu (and more) at the end of and be the no 1 player in the eu we're already the no 1 player in nl we're a team of 15 software developers based in (within the creative industry area ) and remote (    ) the team has a focus on software quality which is reflected in the way we work we let gitlab ci perform automated tests and linting then code review each others code before deploying anything in production hard work requires good food therefore we provide free lunch with freshly baked bread at the office like our saas platforms are made for an international audience we're happy to work with talented international students covid19 before covid19 came along we served more than 1000 customers and about api calls per day from our api nl at the moment we've more than quadrupled and growth continues we now (january ) serve 5 million api calls a day due to increased online buyingas a team we were already used to working online a lot so except for the fact we're not sharing a drink together every now and then workwise everything remained similar daily standups through video conference code review through gitlab and so on you're free to choose whether to work in the office or from home we agree on goals together you figure out what works best for you to achieve them with or without covid19 that's our guiding principle what we offer challenging project (we adjust the project to match your skills) exceptional learning possibilities (daily mentoring) work satisfaction (your code in production within months) a nice internship remuneration (and double if you also graduate here) what you'll gain we apply the latest methodologies in our work daily standups sprint and planning meeting every two weeks you'll experience it all we love writing high quality code we expect you to already write code code and we help you to get even better at it we expect you to play with the latest technology and share your experiences just as we all do that's how we keep everything fresh within the project too because of our daily standups daily mentoring our intensive code review process you'll not be left lingering alone we'll challenge you during those 5 months and try to get you from being a good programmer to a great one your skills  you just love programming you didn't stop when the required school assignments were completed but at least have a hobby project to show as well we'd love to discuss that project's architecture and code with you  you're a selfstarter you're not the type who waits until the 'boss' asks you to do something especially in these covid19 times where you may work at home all day you have to be able to motivate yourself you have a plan know why you're doing this and you know how you'll be achieving it you need to be able to speak write in english speaking dutch is nice but not a requirement so are you ready to improve our platform and your own skills apply or get more info please apply through email ( ) and include the following:  your motivation (please don't send me one of those generic motivations that apply to any company i'd love to read what you'd like to achieve with us in relation to what you read above) one or more projects that show your current code skill level on a publically accessible git repo that includes your commit history (which programming language doesn't matter) in case you rather keep it private you can invite me through github (username: ) or

improve your reactjs frontend and backend python development skills you are already familiar with either and would like to become a better fullstack developer the project we're improving healthcare for children with tos (speech disability) through technology where big gains can be made (it's a niche where until now there's not a lot of software solutions were applied previously) your solution allows speech therapists to work more efficient and automate otherwise tedious work we're developing a suite of connected webapplications some are for young end users practicing their pronunication others are for researchers others are for entering data to improve the machine learning algorithms with here's a screenshot of two of the tools you'll be working on where the input is audio the output is recognised speech a human can verify the recognition of the machine learning algorithm and perform corrections asking a human to just correct saves a lot of time vs performing the complete transcription from scratch these corrections also serve as improvements for the machine learning algorithm's next round of training the company we're a team of 16 software developers based in (within the creative industry area ) and remote (    ) most of our employees were former students top of their class now working fulltime or in a side job the team has a focus on software quality which is reflected in the way we work we let gitlab ci perform automated tests and linting then code review each others code before deploying anything in production hard work requires good food therefore we

backend development skills you are already familiar with either and would like to become a better fullstack developer the project within we develop and run several saas platforms three of those platforms can already accept customer payments (through mollie a payment service provider handling ideal creditcards direct debit payments and several foreign payment methods as well) we're seeing a rising need for several other of our saas platforms to also start accepting customer payments we want to prevent writing the same code over and over leading to a high maintenance burden your project is investigating if a centralised payment service (handling customer payments generating pdf invoices providing an admin cms panel ) for all our saas platforms would be feasible and how to implement this in such a way that each of our saas platforms connecting to it has some level of flexibility in the payment flow presented to the user should we go for writing it as a microservice should we deploy one central version or just code on version that's then instantiated once for each saas preventing a single point of failure you see there's your research question let's make the decisions and start building the actual payment system reach out to the developers of the several saas systems in order to get their feedback on your architecture and try out the implementation since it's about payments let's not forget unit and e2e tests your fresh ideas will be appreciated here let's make something cool together the company we're a team of 16 software developers based in (within the

reactjs frontend and backend nodejs development skills you are already familiar with either and would like to become a better fullstack developer the project is an open source platform where we allow users to build their own apps in lowcode in our lowcode editor we offer building blocks to configure an app quickly with ease optionally attach datasources to the apps and manage them in a public or private appstore your project deals with improving and extending the platform there are several ways to influence your graduation project assignment you can assemble (pun intended) your own assignment by picking interesting challenges from our issue tracker:  groups    issues sort=updated_desc state=opened you can think about what you want to learn the next 5 months and we'll assemble an assignment that's tailored to your wishes and the needs of the platform choose this premade assignment: build a pubbattle app visitors of pubs on stratumseind are going to battle it out together against the other pubs data will be shared amongst the pubs it's about connecting visitors the pubs and collectively gaining value from the data shared this would be ideal for someone who has a software profile but also has game design affinity choose this premade assignment: we're picking one system currently in use in restaurant dinner in motion could be the online reservation system a seating arrangement system (who to put on which table optimizing for efficiency and possibly interesting conversations) automated food ordering system based on daily reservations those systems are currently in use from a closed source vendor which is in some cases unwilling to add functionality dinner in motion needs that's why we're rebuilding it in open source building an open source ecosystem for restaurants and allowing any future modifications the company lowcode is not going away we're only seeing more of it and it's projected that in 10 years time 80% of the applications will be nocode or lowcode apps there are several competitors of ours but none of them is open source we feel it's very important to be this open alternative has been developed with the following principles: has been developed with the following principles: open source no vendor lockin use of modern standards (pwa react   nodejs docker kubernetes oauth2 jwt) pragmatic: rather minimal functionality today than a great app tomorrow we iterate towards it every day an app is built by creating an app recipe in a human readable (yaml   json) format building blocks are chosen and configured here apps should be easy to share copy and customize graphical choices are independent of the app and are defined at the organizational level we're a team of 16 software developers based in (within the creative industry area ) and remote most of our employees were former students top of their class now working fulltime or in a side job the team has a focus on software quality which is reflected in the way we work we let gitlab ci perform automated tests and linting then code review each others code before deploying anything in production hard work requires good food therefore we provide free lunch with freshly baked bread at the office like our saas platforms are made for an international audience we're happy to work with talented international students you're free to choose whether to work in the office or from home (or a mix) we agree on goals together you figure out what works best for you to achieve them with or without covid19 that's always our guiding principle what we offer challenging project (we adjust the project to match your skills) exceptional learning possibilities (daily mentoring) work satisfaction (your code in production within months) a nice internship remuneration (and double if you also graduate here) what you'll gain we apply the latest methodologies in our work daily standups sprint and planning meeting every two weeks you'll experience it all we love writing high quality code we expect you to already write good code and we help you to get even better at it we expect you to play with the latest technology and share your experiences just as we all do that's how we keep everything fresh within the project too because of our daily standups daily mentoring our intensive code review process you'll not be left lingering alone we'll challenge you during those 5 months and try to get you from being a good programmer to a great one ask any previous intern this is the internship where they've learned the most (we promised no harm if they stated otherwise) your skills you just love programming you didn't stop when the required school assignments were completed but at least have a hobby project to show as well we'd love to discuss that project's architecture and code with you you're a selfstarter you're not the type who waits until the 'boss' asks you to do something especially in these covid19 times you have to be able to motivate yourself you have a plan and we'll help you in achieving it it's fine to have a preference for either frontend or backend development but we do encourage the fullstack developer attitude it just works better if you can understand your coworkers who might be specialized in the other area or you can make some small tweaks yourself apply or get more info please apply through email ( ) and include the following (in order of importance): your motivation (please don't send me one of those generic motivations that apply to any company i'd love to read what you'd like to achieve with us in relation to what you read above) one or more projects that show your current code skill level on a publically accessible git repo that includes your commit history (which programming language doesn't matter) in case you rather keep it private you can invite me through github (username: ) or gitlab (username: ) i promise i just look at it for the purpose of this application your cv your grade list

skills and interest we'll make good plan together some tasks could include: adding several new features as requested by our users improving on several areas where google lighthouse indicates we can do a better job architectural changes that might be needed to provide a great free tier experience for many users moving towards less dependencies on (our current host) to allow moving to any cloud in the future the company we're a team of 20 software developers based in (within the creative industry area ) and remote most of our employees were former students top of their class now working fulltime or in a side job after their internship the team has a focus on software quality which is reflected in the way we work we let gitlab ci perform automated tests and linting then code review each others code before deploying anything in production hard work requires good food therefore we provide free lunch with freshly baked bread at the office like our saas platforms are made for an international audience we're happy to work with talented international students you're free to choose whether to work in the office or from home (or a mix) we agree on goals together you figure out what works best for you to achieve them with or without covid19 that's always our guiding principle what we offer challenging project (we adjust the project to match your skills) exceptional learning possibilities (daily mentoring) work satisfaction (your code in production within months) a nice internship remuneration (and double if you also graduate here) a modern software development stack () what you'll gain we apply the latest methodologies in our work daily standups sprint and planning meeting every two weeks you'll experience it all we love writing high quality code we expect you to already write good code and we help you to get even better at it we expect you to play with the latest technology and share your experiences just as we all do that's how we keep everything fresh within the project too because of our daily standups daily mentoring our intensive code review process you'll not be left lingering alone we'll challenge you during those 5 months and try to get you from being a good programmer to a great one ask any previous intern this is the internship where they've learned the most (we promised no harm if they stated otherwise) your skills you just love programming you didn't stop when the required school assignments were completed and have a hobby project to show we'd love to discuss that project's architecture and code with you you're a selfstarter you're not the type who waits until the 'boss' asks you to do something it's expected of you to bring your creative ideas to make the product better surprise us please you need to be able to speak write in english (code and issues are all in english) speaking dutch can be handy but is not a requirement so are you ready to improve education and your own skills apply or get more info please apply through email ( ) and include the following: your motivation (please don't send me one of those generic motivations that apply to any company i'd love to read what you'd like to achieve with us in relation to what you read above) one or more projects that show your current code skill level on a publicly accessible git repo that includes your commit history (which programming language doesn't matter) in case you rather keep it private you can invite me through github (username: ) or gitlab (username: ) your cv your grade list (optional),https://vimeo.com/207436709,2022-08-29

9802F0E2-1DBA-4C2A-B70D-9D1CDC43CDEC,reducing damage and crop loss due to attack from wild animals ,introduction we are fairtrade original and go to the places where flavour begins since 1959 we have been working on fairtrade together with many different (farmers and other) partners all around the world we offer fair products with the original flavour of the origin farmed and processed in the country of origin in this way the original flavour is being maintained to your kitchen fairtrade original is a 100% fairtrade company and a social enterprise we invest our profit in further development of the farmers we work with apart from fair trading practices (import and sales) we offer interventions to our supply chain actors (especially the farmers but also to our suppliers the factories producing our products) support and guidance through development interventions fairtrade original practices trade that develops our mission is: to enable farmers to achieve a living income besides paying a fair price to the farmers another aspect in working towards a living income is maximizing production and harvests and reducing farm losses we are in direct contact with our suppliers and their farmer groups one of our suppliers ma’s tropical food processing is purchasing their raw products from farmer groups in the southern and central regions of  the farmers produce coconuts rice onions sugar cane and spices which are bought as fairtrade certified by ma’s tropical food who processes the produce into our creamy coconut milk and curry pastes which we sell in mainly the dutch retail supermarkets the problem a small n ocean island rich in nature is also home to four million small farmers whose main livelyhood has been agriculture for time immemorial however due to rapid urbanisation and to the many hardships faced by the farmers loss of crop yields and at times life due to attack from wild animals is fast becoming a common occurrence in addition the country has now declared bankruptcy fuelling hyperinflation driving poverty and malnutrition among these small farmer communities while coconut spices are long term perennial crops the rest are annual or shortterm crops the main damage comes due to wild boar elephant giant squirrel porcupine peacock and monkeys the animal can be segregated into two groups; those who attack coconut and those attacking other crops when the longterm crops are attacked it may destroy efforts and income between one to 20 years of hard work while in the case of annual crops a family’s yearly income maybe lost many producers of this producer group are experiencing challenges with crop damage caused by wild animals each type of animal is causing its own type of destruction which results in production losses off in particular coconuts for the farmers besides productions losses human movements are limited due to wild animals (elephants) attacking people when working in their fields or during movements resulting in children not going to schools etc methods such as electric fences seem to be not working due to poor maintenance by the authorities or methods used by wild animal to avoid such deterrence’s in addition to crop damage attacks on humans by monkeys and elephants is another issue these farmers communities face the human elephant conflict annually results in around 150 people of whom some are children and the same number of elephants losing their life the issue of monkeys attacking humans is also a common occurrence which could result in hydrophobia research question to research the behaviour of the wild animals in what way they cause problems to the farming families and in their fields to search for a cheap simple method to deter or chase away animals in an acceptable and human manner so that they do not damage plants and crops some optional solutions could be: the solution might be developing a simple machine that makes a loud sound when tripped or by use of motion or heat sensor it could be a sound emitting device with certain sound frequencies emitted over a limited space dissuading the animal entering this space equipment which could emit a type of odour and sound disliked by animals when tripped a compressed air canister with a vapour (eg spray ) that may chase animals when it is sprayed at timed intervals methodology we would like to bring this problem forward to two students of two technical universities one in the and one in preferably a member of a farmer family affected by this issue attending the country’s foremost engineering faculty katubadda the problem solution is to be worked out by both university students in close cooperation together in a sense that both students learn from each other concerning problem solving culture environment and universities the students will complement one another in knowledge and technology and will work on a pragmatic solution that will be low costs and available to be made within the country of production the majority of the assignment will be done from home country (for the dutch student) with some field visits by the n student results a technical solution to chase animals from the farm and fields or deterring them entering the area that is of low costs affordable for farmer families and can be made within  the solutions should not be connected to an electricity source though can have its own mobile energy source it should be human and animal friendly and cannot have a negative effect on the environment the use of renewable energy will be of additional interest,,,,F2CE05F4-ADD5-4964-9F58-A5F212923AF4,2022-10-06 14:14:18.113,2022-11-02 11:13:08.037,1,English

99209E82-8597-48D6-B7D7-72BC02C8D96A,artificial intelligence for configuration,in recent years artificial intelligence has proven to be an excellent tool to solve a wide range of problems not only does the scope of ai seem to have no limit it also dramatically reduces the amount of code an application needs embracing such techniques would therefore surely help infobridge building new apps and bringing them to market faster as of today we don’t use artificial intelligence in any project and an exploration of the possibilities offered by ai and how they would be relevant for our products is necessary our application for is the best candidate to start this exploration helps customers importing data into crm without writing any code but it does require quite some configuration in the demo video one of the configuration steps is speeded up because it is rather simple but tedious this step consists in mapping every column from a source file to a field in and we think it could be automated we considered writing code that would automatically figure out which column should be matched to which field based on the names but there is too much variability in the column names these column names come from files provided by our users in their own language and without following any rules as we purposefully didn’t give them any however there are similarities between files coming from different customers and rather than writing an algorithm with many rules and exceptions we could train a model with the + data points we collected over the past few years and let it predict the mapping as the use of artificial intelligence grows not every developer is expected to become a machine learning expert instead microsoft offers a set of tools on its azure cloud platform to enable it companies to create aipowered apps with very little knowledge about ai therefore the assignment will mostly revolve around azure machine learning where the intern is expected to train a model then integrate the resulting web service into and finally use mlops to automatically retrain the model when users input new data into  by the end of the assignment the graduate can expect to have acquired a set of skills that touch the following areas: devops: the intern will get familiar with the azure portal and the resources that are relevant to this project such as azure machine learning azure kubernetes service azure blob storage and many others azure devops services will also play an important role for periodically retraining the model data science: selecting transforming and normalizing the input data as well as evaluating the performance of different models fall in the domain of data scientists machine learning: although writing algorithms will probably be unnecessary understanding existing machine learning algorithms will be important to be able to select the most suitable one development: the predictions of the trained model will be exposed via a rest api endpoint that should be consumed by the web application (csharp) when users are setting up their column mapping one or two graduates the described goal for this assignment is to have ai propose field mapping from the source to match the target platform we believe that this is challenging enough for one graduate however if you want to pick up this graduation project with another graduate or like an extra challenge then the following will be added to the goal besides the field mapping allows users to do quite some more configuration like deduplication and what actions to take when a duplicate is detected and set up data transformations these additional configurations can also be proposed by an ai driven model based on the information we currently have in the configurations what do we offer at  relationships matter this applies to how we engage with customers and partners and to how we treat our employees as a company we value healthy and safe work environments we work actively with the topics of

3A8CBE07-DB4F-4337-A41A-6EEF489F8025,nodejs   react @ 58280f04a9bdb6bd297f962cbf06c1a7: consumer touchpoints in the hospitality industry	,in the past the owner of the business was waiting for you at the door and had your favorite bottle of wine or specialty beer ready in today's world where trends are fading fast and hip places are popping up everywhere and consumers are less and less loyal to a business these kinds of personal experiences are increasingly difficult to find mission vision our mission is to improve the hospitality experience for everyone everywhere our vision is the use of technologies and data to achieve this goal within this scope in our opinion the best way to improve the experience is to personalize it for more information about our product check out our website or the video in the description strategy by creating touchpoints with the consumer and collecting data about preferences we want to enable every company to approach its guests in a personal way we want to make these preferences and the associated suggestions available to both the consumer and the company this of course only if the consumer gives permission for this by sharing this data the consumer can not only expect a better experience but the company also gets the opportunity to reward the consumer for loyalty (on repeat visits for example) not a crm but a grm; guest relationship management current state to date has developed a catering system that includes: a fully developed cash register system production screens for the kitchen and behind the bar and a consumer application with selforder and loyalty by partnering with companies within specific niches within the hospitality industry (hotels: booking engine terraces: selforder etc) we are currently storming the market both in the and abroad although the collaborations with these partners are very important to us we do not want to forget our own strategy; digitally connect and stay in touch with the consumer this internship assignment will focus on that assignment during a 'standard' hospitality experience there are only limited moments when the guest interacts with technology examples are paying at the cash register reserving a table online or ordering a drink yourself for  it is of great strategic importance that all possible 'digital consumer touchpoints' are mapped and that we develop possibilities to obtain a unique reference to a consumer at each of these moments it software our stack currently consists of 5 different microservices (back office pointofsale consumer api and cron) with a shared core this shared core contains the data definitions and the associated models all these services are written based on mongodb nodejs meteor and react in short the entire stack is based on javascript (no really and we are happy with it too) the ddp data protocol (based on websockets) within meteor enables realtime data connections circleci is used for builds and we have a growing number of automated tests ict and media design designing elaborating and concretizing the above strategy; in doing so the way in which our proposition is communicated to both the consumer and the entrepreneur must be taken into account in addition the hospitality industry (at least where experience is still somewhat important) is a largely 'offline' market; seamlessly integrating interactions with systems is therefore a major (ux) challenge ict technology we have one codebase that works on all devices (windows android ios linux macos) we make hybrid apps with capacitor which gives us the opportunity to pierce through the web layer directly to the os layer in order to connect the 'offline' world of the hospitality industry with the online world of today we do this through a driver implemented in javascript which uses raw tcp sockets to control specific hardware this lowlevel communication is linked to meteor's ddp data protocol to realize a kind of 'decentralized hardware communication service' not complex enough then you can always dive into the framework it business providing insight into and visualizing the results achieved by our various services (loyalty selforder etc) is of great importance for the success of the business case developing saas software is like implementing a gigantic erp that transcends the boundaries of organizations where not only every person within an organization but also every organization has different wishes this brings great challenges,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAHZWhrrSzc,2023-01-21 00:00:00.000,300.0,8033B276-6762-4273-B9BC-9987835B21AB,2022-11-11 09:44:29.097,2024-06-14 12:44:31.467,3,English

semiconductor industrythese machines are used to put electrical components onto a substrate the components are picked from feeder devices and placed on an allocated position on the printed circuit boards (pcb) within k s we have a continuous automatic build process (ci cd) which builds and tests all control software layersduring this build process problems may occur which results in failed buildscurrently for each build failure an issue created within our jira environmentthis is a manual process which cost a lot of time during the internship or graduation period you become part of one of the control software teams which contain between 8 and 10 team memberswithin this team feature development is one of the core elements and you will be highly involved in this process you will learn how product development is done within k s by using an agile way of working problem descriptionit’s only allowed to merge new changes to the develop branch with a green pull request run (pr run) this pr run is mandatory to enforce continuous integration in this pr run we have 100+ different test suites which take in total take about ~8 hours to execute we run these tests in parallel to reduce lead time due to this the whole pr run takes about ~3 hours because of this pr run our feedback loop during development is very big before you can finish a task you will have to wait for a green pr run which minimally takes ~3 hours at his moment we separated our test suites based on configuration this separation is not optimal the optimal solution would be to evenly separate all your test suites over all the test agents available assignmentdevelop a tool that automatically load balances test suites over test agentsthis tool should use the test duration data from a previous run to decide how to separate the different test suites over the test pcsthe tool should also take into account the required preconditions of the test suites all test suites need to be executed on a virtual machine with a specific configuration thus when executing a new test suite on a test agent which required a different configuration it could be the case we need to spin up a new virtual machine which takes ~5 minutes the goals of this assignment:• participate in organization with agile way of software development• come up with a solution how to load balance test suites over test agents• plan design implement and test the deliverables• present the changes and improvements made to stakeholders your profile qualifications• educational track: software engineering• internship type: regular internship

internship graduation project to improve your reactjs frontend and backend nodejs development skills you are already familiar with either and would like to become a better fullstack developer your project is an open source platform where we allow users to build their own apps in lowcode in our lowcode studio we offer building blocks to configure an app quickly with ease optionally attach datasources to the apps and manage them in a public or private appstore your project deals with improving and extending the lowcode language and the platform itself premade assignment 1: build a development server that allows other developers to easily develop lowcode blocks on their local system you can compare it to something like the emulator that allows you to run locally before deploying to the cloud see:       issues  premade assignment 2: even thought about creating your own programming language now you can work on extending our lowcode scripting language to make it practical we'll give you a lowcode app to develop for a real customer usually about 70% of the functionality can be built by the framework already however the remaining 30% of functionality can't be built in lowcode yet because the framework is lacking functionality so 80% of your time is actually spent at improving extending the low code language the missing building blocks in order to deliver the app your remaining 20% of the time will be spent on delivering the actual app in lowcode as proof your additions actually work premade assignment 3: we have a bunch of data sales data from the last few 10 years can you add an ai block to that takes that data makes a prediction about future sales this is an example of how we'd like to approach ai just drag drop your ai prediction block connect it to a data source on the input a graph block on the output presto you just performed magic using ai users would love that now we just have to build it and make it easy for them we have the actual sales data of course however an app that predicts whether you can wear shorts tomorrow based on historic temperature data on your location (you can obtain location in lowcode already) might be a fun example app to show customers what ai can do too there are several ways to influence your project assignment: you can assemble (no pun intended) your own assignment by picking interesting challenges from our issue tracker:  groups    issues sort=updated_desc state=opened you can think about what you want to learn the next 5 months and we'll assemble an assignment that's tailored to your wishes and the needs of the platform to get an example of how your contributions could look like see the results from one of our last semesters' interns:  groups    merge_requests scope=all state=all author_username=ekhorn the company lowcode is not going away we're only seeing more of it and it's projected that in 10 years time 80% of the applications will be nocode or lowcode apps there are several competitors of ours but none of them is open source we feel it's very important to build this open alternative has been developed with the following principles: open source no vendor lockin use of modern standards (pwa reactjs   nodejs docker kubernetes oauth2 jwt jest cypress) an app is built by creating an app recipe in a human readable (yaml   json) format building blocks are chosen and configured here apps should be easy to share copy and customize you should be able to toggle between coding in yaml and the gui drag drop editor we're a team of 20 software developers based in

platforms you already love to tinker with linux have a passion for open source git and docker are your friends python scripting doesn't scare you you're now ready to take it to the next level current situation is the umbrella company for our various saas products for the last 10 years we've been running dockerized code in the google and clouds for serveral reasons we're pulling out of that infrastructure one of our brands  is the leading cloud based geodata platform where clients use our api to connect their webshop or application with our database of geodata it's a high performance api serving millions of api requests a day for more than 1000 customers we've already finetuned a lot current hosting costs are about € 500  month we have an auxillary vps on digital ocean it runs smoothly when a developer sets a tag to deploy a new version ci kicks it off deploys runs database schema migrations if it has to it'll roll back to the previous version when something fails we like it but we'd like to move out of the google cloud because:  vendor lockin: we use the proprietary google app engine speed: you'd think with google you get high speed think again google doesn't host gae apps in any of the nl datacenters so we're serving our dutch customers from currently latency 100ms for each api call is really important for our customers this really doesn't help privacy concerns: it's an american company after all privacy shield collapsed a while ago our european customers are not benefitting in any way from that your project so we've been working to replace python google sdk libraries were using with generic libraries it could now be running in a container on any vps for example we could host on for only 1 4th of the costs we'd like to be able to move to another generic cloud provider relatively fast after  we'd like to look at the other infrastructure we have many vps's running tools like mailcow jitsi nextcloud because early we pulled out of for our company email video conferencing partly for cost reasons mostly privacy concerns and again vendor lockin we'd like to take a bunch of vps's to setup kubernetes an run all these applications (and more: there's self hosted gitlab bitwarden and so on) on a nicely structured kubernetes cluster where all applications have letsencrypt ssl configured proper helm charts for each app as research question think about surveying the ecosystem should we consider portainerio openstack or rancher instead can we also script d settings we've been selecting d providers that have an api so we could use ansible or terraform to really script everything from start to end we'd like to start migrating our staging environments to your new architecture and try it out you document everything along the way so we'll be able to

improve your reactjs frontend (typescript) and python backend development skills you are already familiar with either and would like to become a better fullstack developer the project we're improving primary education and healthcare for children with tos (speech disability) through technology where big gains can be made (it's a niche where until now there's not a lot of software solutions were applied previously) your solution allows speech therapists to work more efficient and automate otherwise tedious work we're developing a suite of connected webapplications some are for young end users practicing their pronunication others are for researchers others are for entering data to improve the machine learning algorithms with here's a screenshot of two of the tools you'll be working on where the input is audio the output is recognised speech a human can verify the recognition of the machine learning algorithm and perform corrections asking a human to just correct saves a lot of time vs performing the complete transcription from scratch these corrections also serve as improvements for the machine learning algorithm's next round of trainingdepending on the project that's the best fit for you you'll be working with reactjs + python or nextjs + node tasks include adding new features we've planned and bugfixing whenever they're reported by our users it could also be interesting to work on rethinking and restructuring architectural decisions that in hindsight might not be ideal for future growth of the project the company we're a team of 20 software developers based in (within the creative industry area ) and remote most of our employees were former students top of their class now working fulltime or in a side job after their internship the team has a focus on software quality which is reflected in the way we work we let gitlab ci perform automated tests and linting then code review each others code before deploying anything in production hard work requires good food therefore we provide free lunch with freshly baked bread at the office like our saas platforms are made for an international audience we're happy to work with talented international students you're free to choose whether to work in the office or from home (or a mix) we agree on goals together you figure out what works best for you to achieve them what we offer challenging project (we customize the project to match your skills) exceptional learning possibilities (daily mentoring in after our daily standups) a comprehensive internship bootcamp program in your first month work satisfaction (your code in production within weeks from starting) a nice internship remuneration (and double if you also graduate here) what you'll gain we apply the latest methodologies in our work daily standups sprint and planning meeting every two weeks you'll experience it all we love writing high quality code we expect you to already write good code and we help you to get even better at it we expect you to play with the latest technology and share your experiences just as we all do that's how we keep everything fresh within the project too because of our daily standups daily mentoring our intensive code review process you'll not be left lingering alone we'll challenge you during those 5 months and try to get you from being a good programmer to a great one ask any previous intern this is the internship where they've learned the most (we promised no harm if they stated otherwise) your skills you just love programming you didn't stop when the required school assignments were completed but at least have a hobby project to show as well we'd love to discuss that project's architecture and code with you you're a selfstarter you're not the type who waits until the 'boss' asks you to do something especially in these covid19 times you have to be able to motivate yourself you have a plan and we'll help you in achieving it you need to be able to speak write in english (code and issues are all in english) speaking dutch can be handy but is not a requirement so are you ready to improve education and your own skills apply or get more info please apply through email ( ) and include the following: your motivation (please don't send me one of those generic motivations that apply to any company i'd love to read what you'd like to achieve with us in relation to what you read

young and dynamic team and we try to make the world a little bit better will you join us in our mission of monitoring nature a lot better  or do you want to enable policymakers on ecology to work in a more datadriven way  or do you want to enable us to monitor biodiversity underwater if that's the case than you can apply for one of the following missions and together we can formulate an assignment that fits both our needs and ambitions we don't care when you start mission #1: monitoring of nature provides a unique service to terrain managing companies like staatsbosbeheer natuurmonumenten and waterschappen basically any organization that manages or owns protected nature (natura areas) we use drones to make very high detailed mappings of nature areas and analyze these mapping with ai algorithms the algorithms classify which species of plants are located on the ground our clients need this information to direct their personnel to perform interventions to conserve these beautiful areas for instance by removing invasive species looking for a data science assignment even though we have working models and software pipelines we could really use some help with creating better algorithms as a company we can only optimize our models for a certain amount of time before we need to move to the next job to keep the money flowing in so there is definitely room for improvements on the models perhaps we should be using a different model altogether we also have datasets for which we haven’t been able to create models for yet do you have experience with training models we might be looking for you to answer these questions: what are we overlooking in our current models how can we optimize these models in future how can we optimize our overall training strategy looking for a software engineering assignment as mentioned we create all kinds of models experiment with them and change the dataset to test which annotations are the best to in or exclude we use a lot of georeferenced spatial data that is huge in size we are in dire need of a system that: allows us to better manage and track all of this data get visual feedback on the data used vs output of the models and keep track of what data was used in combination with what model and which settings can you help us with designing and building such a system that runs either on one of our servers or in the cloud and uses all the latest techniques tools languages we use (nonexhaustive list): python react general javascript postgresql with postgis plugin (spatial data addon) we are open to solutions in other languages mission #2: encourage datadriven working (in ecology departments) within governmental organizations the data that results from our algorithms is delivered to our customers through a webportal in this portal they can see the difference between annual scans we have built this portal in a hurry and it works however it is definitely not a piece of brilliance we need to understand better what our clients' needs are so we can design a portal that meets their expectations and helps them to do their work better can you help us investigate our clients needs and deliver us a first prototype (or the finished product if you are a genius) of a portal that really fits our clients needs tools languages we use (nonexhaustive list): react general javascript php mysql postgresql with postgis plugin (spatial data addon) we are open to solutions in other languages mission #3: goes underwater we want to expand our monitoring of nature to the underwater realm and monitor biodiversity with autonomous underwater vehicles (auv) our ambition is to make mappings in exactly the same way as we do with drones this will require an auv that can navigate very precisely via a predetermined path in this stage the sensors for monitoring are unimportant firstly we want to realize the “platform” on (or behind) which sensors can be mounted (or towed) a special challenge with underwater vehicles without an umbilical cable is underwater communication usually this is done via an ultrashort baseline acoustic positioning system there are several subchallenges that can be addressed separately: realize communication with the surveying ship realize an accurate underwater positioning system designing an auv from scratch programming the autonomousness looking for an embedded systems assignment whilst designing an auv is of course very cool this is not the first priority we would like you to focus on subchallenges one and two first there are offtheshelf solutions to handle the first two subchallenges but they tend to be very expensive (starting at 15k) this is beyond our budget so we need a creative mind to come up with a less expensive custom build solution can you help us to design an underwater platform capable of carrying and or towing sensors in the future we are open to solutions in any language,,2023-02-01

internship graduation project to improve your reactjs frontend and backend nodejs development skills you are already familiar with either and would like to become a better fullstack developer the project we're improving reading skills in primary education and healthcare for children with tos (speech disability) through technology where big gains can be made (it's a niche where until now there's not a lot of software was applied previously) this solution allows speech therapists to work more efficient and automate otherwise tedious work we're developing a suite of connected webapplications some are for young children practicing their pronunication together with their therapist or parents at home others are for researchers we also have tools for humans to provide input in order to improve the machine learning algorithms here's two screenshots of our electronic learning environment (elo) where our speech technology can be experienced in a fresh ui many elo's exist but none are exclusively focussed on speech related assignments that's why we developed one ourselves several clients now use it your contribution during this internship to the project depends on your skills and interest we'll make good plan together the following can be taken as actual project assignments (or can be mashed up into a more personal project plan): add ways to include parents in the excercises the children need to do (inviting parents through email providing them an account to the system that'll guide them through once logged in) this should reduce pressure on healthcare professionals and makes parents more aware of what the kid is doing make the platform more accessible by improving on several areas where google lighthouse indicates we can do a better job make architectural changes at the start of the project we've chosen firebase for the backend since gdpr is a thing firebase locks us in the google cloud we want to have to option of moving to another more privacy friendly cloud in the future (using only open source   dockerized services) work on improved integration with 3rd party systems we have a user management portal that connects to and it needs to connect to to several 3rd party systems for gathering student data which is already in these systems connecting to more systems means we can use in more schools and healthcare organisations the company we're a team of 20 software developers based in (within the creative industry area ) and remote most of our employees were former students top of their class now working fulltime or in a side job after their internship the team has a focus on software quality which is reflected in the way we work we let gitlab ci perform automated tests and linting then code review each others code before deploying anything in production hard work requires good food therefore we provide free lunch with freshly baked bread at the office like our saas platforms are made for an international audience we're happy to work with talented international students you're free to choose whether to work in the office or from home (or a mix) we agree on goals together you figure out what works best for you to achieve them what we offer challenging project (we adjust the project to match your skills) exceptional learning possibilities (daily mentoring in after our daily standups) work satisfaction (your code in production within weeks from starting) a nice internship remuneration (and double if you also graduate here) a modern software development stack (typescript) what you'll gain we apply the latest methodologies in our work daily standups sprint and planning meeting every two weeks you'll experience it all we love writing high quality code we expect you to already write good code and we help you to get even better at it we expect you to play with the latest technology and share your experiences just as we all do that's how we keep everything fresh within the project too because of our daily standups daily mentoring our intensive code review process you'll not be left lingering alone we'll challenge you during those 5 months and try to get you from being a good programmer to a great one ask any previous intern this is the internship where they've learned the most (we promised no harm if they stated otherwise) your skills you just love programming you didn't stop when the required school assignments were completed and have a hobby project to show we'd love to discuss that project's architecture and code with you you're a selfstarter you're not the type who waits until the 'boss' asks you to do something it's expected of you to bring your creative ideas to make the product better surprise us please you need to be able to speak write in english (code and issues are all in english) speaking dutch can be handy but is not a requirement so are you ready to improve education and your own skills apply or get more info please apply through email ( ) and include the following: your motivation (please don't send me one of those generic motivations that apply to any company i'd love to read what you'd like to achieve with us in relation to what you read above) one

it) if you live in the and ordered something online it's certain you've already used our service (unknowingly) you filled in your postcode and street number so the website would automatically tell you what street and city your parcel will be shipped to you'll be adding new functionality to our new customer portal (where users can basically selfservice what they need) for our 1000 customers to use the screenshot below is our new tailwind css and nextjs based website the backend is written using python 310 all of this is complemented with unittests where needed and playwright endtoend tests that run in ci to guarantee stability within this context we provide two projects for you to choose from and tailor:  technically restructure the api and portal while the technologies used are fresh we kind of ported older code to this new technology without actually restructuring the architecture used it's not bad but it might not be maintainable well enough or scale well enough for our ambitions in the next 10 years we already have a lot of tests in place so whatever is rearchitected should not modify the existing api output our clients depend on but the rest is open  we'd like to provide our users with many more code examples on how to use our api we can choose between generating examples in many programming languages or create custom code in each that's one research question right there whatever it'll be it'd be good to keep all of the examples on for users to see and use also when looking at the code examples from our website it'd great if snippets already would contain their personalised api key (when they're logged in) for example ready to copypaste making it super user friendly the company we're a team of 20 software developers based in (within the creative industry

primary education and healthcare for children with tos (speech disability) through technology where big gains can be made (it's a niche where until now there's not a lot of software solutions were applied previously) your solution allows speech therapists to work more efficient and automate otherwise tedious work we're developing a suite of connected webapplications some are for young end users practicing their pronunication others are for researchers others are for entering data to improve the machine learning algorithms with here's a screenshot of two of the tools you'll be working on where the input is audio the output is recognised speech a human can verify the recognition of the machine learning algorithm and perform corrections asking a human to just correct saves a lot of time vs performing the complete transcription from scratch these corrections also serve as improvements for the machine learning algorithm's next round of trainingdepending on the project that's the best fit for you you'll be working with reactjs + python or nextjs + node tasks include adding new features we've planned and bugfixing whenever they're reported by our users it could also be interesting

offer a great internship graduation project to improve your reactjs frontend and backend nodejs development skills you are already familiar with either and would like to become a better fullstack developer your project is an open source platform where we allow users to build their own apps in lowcode in our lowcode studio we offer building blocks to configure an app quickly with ease optionally attach datasources to the apps and manage them in a public or private appstore your project deals with improving and extending the lowcode language and the platform itself premade assignment 1: our gui editor allows nontechnical people to build apps using drag drop functionality a working prototype exists but it's far from a completed production version you'll be extending functionality to make the gui editor much more featureful and user friendly see for the actual status and plans:  groups    epics 11 premade assignment 2: even thought about creating your own programming language now you can work on extending our lowcode scripting language to make it practical we'll give you a lowcode app to develop for a real customer usually about 70% of the functionality can be built by the framework already however the remaining 30% of functionality can't be built in lowcode yet because the framework is lacking functionality so 80% of your time is actually spent at improving extending the low code language the missing building blocks in order to deliver the app your remaining 20% of the time will be spent on delivering the actual app in lowcode as proof your additions actually work premade assignment 3: we have a bunch of data sales data from the last few 10 years can you add an ai block to that takes that data makes a prediction about future sales this is an example of how we'd like to approach ai just drag drop your ai prediction block connect it to a data source on the input a graph block on the output presto you just performed magic using ai users would love that now we just have to build it and make it easy for them we have the actual sales data of course however an app that predicts whether you can wear shorts tomorrow based on historic temperature data on your location (you can obtain location in lowcode already) might be a fun example app to show customers what ai can do too there are several ways to influence your project assignment: you can assemble (no pun intended) your own assignment by picking interesting challenges from our issue tracker:  groups    issues sort=updated_desc state=opened you can think about what you want to learn the next 5 months and we'll assemble an assignment that's tailored to your wishes and the needs of the platform to get an example of how your contributions could look like see the results from one of our last semesters' interns:  groups    merge_requests scope=all state=all author_username=ekhorn the company lowcode is not going away we're only seeing more of it and it's projected that in 10 years time 80% of the applications will be nocode or lowcode apps there are several competitors of ours but none of them is open source we feel it's very important to build this open alternative has been developed with the following principles: open source no vendor lockin use of modern standards (pwa reactjs   nodejs docker kubernetes oauth2 jwt jest cypress) an app is

DB37F50B-D0E1-46D1-AB54-26E435519D74,ai for configuration of data transfer,in recent years artificial intelligence has proven to be an excellent tool to solve a wide range of problems not only does the scope of ai seem to have no limit it also dramatically reduces the amount of code an application needs embracing such techniques would therefore surely help infobridge build new apps and bring them to market faster as of today we don’t use artificial intelligence in any project and an exploration of the possibilities offered by ai and how they would be relevant for our products is necessary our application for is the best candidate to start this exploration helps customers importing data into crm without writing any code but it does require quite some configuration in the demo video one of the configuration steps is speeded up because it is rather simple but tedious this step consists of mapping every column from a source file to a field in and we think it could be automated we considered writing code that would automatically figure out which column should be matched to which field based on the names but there is too much variability in the column names these column names come from files provided by our users in their own language and without following any rules as we purposefully didn’t give them any however there are similarities between files coming from different customers and rather than writing an algorithm with many rules and exceptions we could train a model with the 2500+ data points we collected over the past few years and let it predict the mapping as the use of artificial intelligence grows not every developer is expected to become a machine learning expert instead microsoft offers a set of tools on its azure cloud platform to enable it companies to create aipowered apps with very little knowledge about ai we have worked on a good start to use these ai tools we have a model that can be trained now it’s time to use it to offer our users an even more userfriendly configuration and offer our employees a way to view and react to the predicted mapping and configuration results and inform them about the accuracy of the predictions therefore the assignment will mostly revolve around azure machine learning where the intern is expected to optimise further and develop the model integrate the web service into and finally use mlops to automatically retrain the model when users input new data into  by the end of the assignment the graduate can expect to have acquired a set of skills that touch the following areas: devops: the intern will get familiar with the azure portal and the resources that are relevant to this project such as azure machine learning azure kubernetes service azure blob storage and many others azure devops services will also play an important role for periodically retraining the model data science: selecting transforming and normalizing the input data as well as evaluating the performance of different models fall in the domain of data scientists machine learning: although writing algorithms will probably be unnecessary understanding existing machine learning algorithms will be important to be able to select the most suitable one  development: the predictions of the trained model will be exposed via a rest api endpoint that should be consumed by the web application (csharp) when users are setting up their column mapping the accuracy of the predicted results must be visualized based on the feedback of the users one or two graduates the described goal for this assignment is to have ai propose field mapping from the source to match the target platform we believe that this is challenging enough for one graduate however if you want to pick up this graduation project with another graduate or like an extra challenge then the following will be added to the goal besides the field mapping allows users to do quite some more configuration like deduplication and what actions to take when a duplicate is detected and set up data transformations these additional configurations can also be proposed by an aidriven model based on the information we currently have in the configurations,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeCaFyQLFV8&t=2s,2024-01-29 00:00:00.000,375.0,B366AA6B-E762-4E16-A0C2-FFB893620518,2023-10-19 16:12:05.400,2023-12-06 10:26:33.677,1,English

improve your reactjs frontend and backend nodejs development skills you are already familiar with either and would like to become a better fullstack developer the project we're improving reading skills in primary education and healthcare for children with tos (speech disability) through technology where big gains can be made (it's a niche where until now there's not a lot of software was applied previously) this solution allows speech therapists to work more efficient and automate otherwise tedious work we're developing a suite of connected webapplications some are for young children practicing their pronunication together with their therapist or parents at home others are for researchers we also have tools for humans to provide input in order to improve the machine learning algorithms here's two screenshots of our electronic learning environment (elo) where our speech technology can be experienced in a fresh ui many elo's exist but none are exclusively focussed on speech related assignments that's why we developed one ourselves several clients now use it your contribution during this internship to the project depends on your skills and interest we'll make good plan together the following can be taken as actual project assignments (or can be mashed up into a more personal project plan): add ways to include parents in the excercises the children need to do (inviting parents through email providing them an account to the system that'll guide them through once logged in) this should reduce pressure on healthcare professionals and makes parents more aware of what the kid is doing make the platform more accessible by improving on several areas where google lighthouse indicates we can do a better job make architectural changes we've recently modernized our backend (moved out of vendor lockin from to nodejs) and a solid open source postgresql database there is still room for further improvements the frontend could do with some serious rearchitecting since the ecosystem is developing fast we recently moved to vite work on improved integration with 3rd party systems we have a user management portal that connects to and it needs to connect to to several 3rd party systems for gathering student data which is already in these systems connecting to more systems means we can use in more schools and healthcare organisations the company we're a team

offer a great internship graduation project to improve your reactjs frontend and backend nodejs development skills you are already familiar with either and would like to become a better fullstack developer your project is an open source platform where we allow users to build their own apps in lowcode in our lowcode studio we offer building blocks to configure an app quickly with ease optionally attach datasources to the apps and manage them in a public or private appstore your project deals with improving and extending the lowcode language and the platform itself premade assignment 1: our gui editor allows nontechnical people to build apps using drag drop functionality a working prototype exists but it's far from a completed production version you'll be extending functionality to make the gui editor much more featureful and user friendly see for the actual status and plans:  groups    epics 16 premade assignment 2: even thought about creating your own programming language now you can work on extending our lowcode scripting language to make it practical we'll give you a lowcode app to develop for a real customer usually about 70% of the functionality can be built by the framework already however the remaining 30% of functionality can't be built in lowcode yet because the framework is lacking functionality so 80% of your time is actually spent at improving extending the low code language the missing building blocks in order to deliver the app your remaining 20% of the time will be spent on delivering the actual app in lowcode as proof your additions actually work premade assignment 3: we have a bunch of data sales data from the last few 10 years can you add an ai block to that takes that data makes a prediction about future sales this is an example of how we'd like to approach ai just drag drop your ai prediction block connect it to a data source on the input a graph block on the output presto you just performed magic using ai users would love that now we just have to build it and make it easy for them we have the actual sales data of course however an app that predicts whether you can wear shorts tomorrow based on historic temperature data on your location (you can obtain location in lowcode already) might be a fun example app to show customers what ai can do too there are several ways to influence your project assignment: you can assemble (no pun intended) your own assignment by picking interesting challenges from our issue tracker:  groups    issues sort=updated_desc state=opened you can think about what you want to learn the next 5 months and we'll assemble an assignment that's tailored to your wishes and the needs of the platform to get an example of how your contributions could look like see the results from one of our last semesters' interns:  groups    merge_requests scope=all state=all author_username=ekhorn the company lowcode is not going away we're only seeing more of it and it's projected that in 10 years time 80% of the applications will be nocode or lowcode apps there are several competitors of ours but none of them is open source we feel it's very important to build this open alternative has been developed with the following principles: open source no vendor lockin use of modern standards (pwa reactjs   nodejs docker kubernetes oauth2 jwt jest cypress) an app is built by creating an app recipe in a human readable (yaml   json) format building blocks are chosen and configured here apps should be easy to share copy and customize you should be able to toggle between coding in yaml and the gui drag drop editor we're a team of 20 software developers based in (within the creative industry area ) and remote most of our employees were former students top of their class now working fulltime or in a side job the team has a focus on software quality which is reflected in the way we work we let gitlab ci perform automated tests and linting then code review each others code before deploying anything in production hard work requires good food therefore we provide free lunch with freshly baked bread at the office like our saas platforms are made for an

to work in the office or from home (or a mix) we agree on goals together you figure out what works best for you to achieve them what we offer challenging project (we customize the project to match your skills) exceptional learning possibilities (daily mentoring in after our daily standups) a comprehensive internship bootcamp program in your first month work satisfaction (your code in production within weeks from starting) a nice internship remuneration (and double if you also graduate here) a modern software development stack (nodejs typescript vite) what you'll gain we apply the latest methodologies in our work daily standups retrospective and sprint planning meeting every two weeks you'll experience it all we love writing high quality code we expect you to already write good code and we help you to get even better at it we expect you to play with the latest technology and share your experiences just as we all do that's how we keep everything fresh within the project too

programmer to a great one ask any previous intern this is the internship where they've learned the most (we promised no harm if they stated otherwise) your skills  you just love programming you didn't

nextjs frontend and incidentally some backend skills you are already familiar with frontend development and would like to not only become a better frontend developer but also expand your knowledge in other directions like python or bash scripting accessibility your project is home of several saas companies for the last many years all saas companies had their own teams responsible for backend frontend development automated testing infrastructure devops security we already had one designer working on all projects part time to jump in when someone required some ui ux knowledge or design updates this year we're making the saas teams smaller and launch several new vertical miniteams that jump from project to project improving in a very focussed domain this vertical could be summarized as the ""promotion vertical"" you'll spar with the other vertical teams too there's the infra devops team security team e2e testing team too for this project we're solving a big problem that most of our saas'es experienced over the years:  improve our accessibility score we'll apply google lighthouse to all pages (using https:  unlighthousedev  for example) and make our frontends shine  improve our visibility to google we're indexed all right but it might need some extra work to make google index us in all of our supported languages as software engineers we're using ci scripts to monitor this and alert us when anything is not ok we verify some keywords that are important to use are indexed by google also we verify that google indexes all languages the saas website offers this provides a matrix of pages to check daily therefore automation is key  consider checking our appearance on other important search engines too for our mostly technical audience duckduckgo is important as well  once the above basics are covered we can go into establishing some analytics using plausible (maybe good to stay away from google analytics privacy wise) and again see if we can wire up scripts that alert us if something bad happens to some metric out of the blue the thing with analytics: no one looks at it on a daily basis so let's push alerts if we need to look at it instead  apply a software engineering mind to seo seo has been known as writing clever text to get on the frontpage of google how can we script our way out of this manual labour of writing tweaking texts can be perhaps use chatgpt for tweaking texts a bit prompt: make this text more readable: works wonders can we also have a seo linter in the ci pipeline that fails the build if anyone tries to merge code that affects seo in a bad way  apply a software engineering mind to adwords automate the tweaking of google adwords campaigns until now it's a manual excercise of excluding certain terms boring let's hope we can

you want to further develop yourself both within your graduation assignment and on a personal level · you are a pleasant and critical conversationalist you easily engage with various levels within our organization and if necessary provide unsolicited advice what do we have to offer you at  you have the space to trust in your own qualities of course with an open mind for the knowledge and experience of your colleagues in practice this means: · a pleasant informal working atmosphere and tailored guidance from enthusiastic professionals · plenty of room for your innovative ideas · an internship or graduation opportunity with a lot of variety within a network that is constantly evolving · (opportunities for) growth after completing your assignment · flexible working hours who are we without movement everything stands still advice engineering realization commissioning and maintenance of industrial installations are also all about agility deploying and managing the right expertise at the right time worldwide respond flexibly to changes constantly searching for innovative solutions services that improve processes we call that manage movement the network – vinci energies' brand for industry – has 23 000 specialists and 400 business units in 40 countries worldwide in the  1 000 enterprising professionals from 23 business units move the industry interested in an internship assignment do you recognize yourself in our description and would you like to complete this assignment then immediately send your motivation with curriculum vitae to recruiter lex laros ( ) would you like more information first if you have any substantive questions about the assignment please contact stefan custers this can be done by email at or by telephone at ,,2024-09-02 00:00:00.000,525.0,8361C720-442E-4060-9873-C30C518DB2A4,2024-04-09 13:38:49.377,2024-05-28 12:01:14.627,3,English

polarization and improved communication across different perspectives the challenge can be approached from different perspectives and can be adjusted to the it area of interest of the student with an interest in: hboi domains: software engineering user interaction itareas: ai engineering web development (frontend backend) ux design context the research group (ixd) is interested in the shape matter and power of our relationship with information in particular we see how humans struggle in the face of information overload: quantity of information (too much or not enough) quality of information (information density ease of use of info) complexity or simplicity of information (too much or too little) this struggle is not new (kierkegaard 1840) but the technologies surrounding us are do those new technologies and the products built around them help us deal with information overload or do they only make things worse we (hereby) pose strategic design experiments for ideas concepts products services and environments with regards to new ways of information moderation transformation curation and publishing by means of (generative) ai part of the experiments is to critically look at the (potential) positive and negative impact of such technologies and ideas on democracy healthcare education journalism arts and cultural exchange museums publishing built environments and crossovers this critical view is essential because it is dubious whether new services such as generative ai are really making us more creative more productive smarter happier work better as a society currently we are pursuing projects that deal with: enticing intellectual and creative pursuits moderating infooverload instead of contributing mediating people using virtual representatives the assignment problem in today's informationrich environment we are often called out to think outofthebox and come up with innovative ideas because this is hard and we are pressed for time it is tempting to let an ai generate ideas for us while the quality of the generated ideas will no doubt improve over time using this technology may offload creative thinking instead of stimulating it we would like to be able to use the strengths of generative ai in lateral thinking (it can easily make connections between two unrelated concepts try it) to genuinely stimulate creative thoughts in the user instead of taking this meaningful activity away from them lateral thinking involves approaching problems from new and unexpected angles often requiring a break from linear thought processes assignment develop a system that enhances lateral thinking by augmenting existing text (eg fiction nonfiction articles) with prompts questions or interactive elements designed to stimulate innovative ideas about an unrelated problem the user is working on we're trying to stimulate the process that leads to the sudden ideas you get while taking a shower or a walk or doing another unrelated activity to do this you need to use new llm technologies to analyze the text being consumed by the user to identify key themes concepts and narratives and link them to the unrelated user's challenge based on the analysis generate thoughtprovoking prompts questions or activities that encourage the user to think about their unrelated problem in new ways these prompts should be subtly integrated into the reading experience without disrupting the flow maybe the original text could be altered research opportunities use llm concepts such as smart prompting text embeddings and semantic space to analyze the content of texts to identify links between an existing texts and unrelated challenges develop algorithms for augmented reading interventions explore the psychological and cognitive impact of augmented reading on creative problemsolving assess the user experience and engagement with the system through user testing and feedback study the (longterm) effects of using such a system on creativity and problemsolving abilities as with all projects we invite you to think critically of the possible impact of anything you create expected outcome depending on the experience and interest of the student we envision: an aiassisted system that takes (part of) the text and generates text augmentations based on a predetermined unrelated user defined challenge (web) platform that offers a pleasant reading experience of existing reading material (perhaps epubs) and includes the aigenerated interventions or augmentations user experience tests and validation whether such a system may enhance (longterm) lateral thinking skills guidance the (the dead philosophers brainstorm to solve everything) is part of the research group (ixd) of ict the is a combination of a thinktank and a creative lab for the research group

stack or modality stack (subject to change): core 1 nugget core meaning: the fundamental contextindependent meaning of the text this is the most abstract representation of an idea or fact stripped of any emotional cultural or stylistic influences 2 lexical semantics: the dictionary meanings of words and phrases and their relationships (eg synonyms antonyms) this layer adds the first level of specificity to the core meaning 3 syntactic structures: grammar and sentence structure that organize words and phrases into coherent statements this modality includes understanding parts of speech and their arrangements these first three layers are so elementary linked to the medium text that together we can represent this as text and preserve the most neutral specific core meaning we could also represent it in a knowledge graph for this project we consider layer 3 as the lowest level of our stack neutral linguistic intent and quality 4 pragmatic context: the intended use of language in situational contexts including speech acts (eg requests offers commands) and implicatures which require an understanding of the speaker’s intentions and the conversational context 5 referential context: the specific entities locations times and realworld references mentioned in the text this layer anchors abstract meanings to concrete instances 6 discourse coherence: the logical flow and connectivity of ideas across sentences and paragraphs ensuring that the text forms a coherent whole rather than disconnected fragments the following three layers add a neutral context to the core message placing it in a particular application context and whether the message has a coherent application at all social code 7 sentiment and emotional tone: the emotional layer of the text which includes sentiments (positive negative neutral) and more specific emotional states (joy anger sadness) 8 cultural references and symbolism: implicit and explicit references that require cultural knowledge to decode including idioms proverbs cultural symbols and allusions 9 sociolinguistic variations: variations in language use influenced by social factors including dialects sociolects and registers this modality reflects the social identity and status of the speaker or writer the next three levels add meaning that resonate in a specific social and cultural context personal identity 10 stylistic features: the choice of words tone and rhetorical devices that reflect the author’s personal style genre conventions or the text’s intended effect on the reader 11 intertextuality: references to and influences from other texts which require knowledge of those texts to understand fully 12 philosophical and ideological stances: the underlying beliefs worldviews and ideologies that shape the perspective from which the text is written 13 temporal and spatial contexts: the historical time geographical place and cultural setting in which the text was produced and is interpreted 14 psychological and personality traits: indications of the psychological state or personality traits of the speaker or writer as inferred from language use patterns,,2024-09-01

student with an interest in: hboi domains: software engineering user interaction itareas: ai engineering web development (frontend backend) ux design context the research group (ixd) is interested in the shape matter and power of our relationship with information in particular we see how humans struggle in the face of information overload: quantity of information (too much or not enough) quality of information (information density ease of use of info) complexity or simplicity of information (too much or too little) this struggle is not new (kierkegaard 1840) but the technologies surrounding us are do those new technologies and the products built around them help us deal with information overload or do they only make things worse we (hereby) pose strategic design experiments for ideas concepts products services and environments with regards to new ways of information moderation transformation curation and publishing by means of (generative) ai part of the experiments is to critically look at the (potential) positive and negative impact of such technologies and ideas on democracy healthcare education journalism arts and cultural exchange museums (digital) publishing and others this critical view is essential because it is dubious whether new services such as generative ai are really making us more creative more productive smarter happier work better as a society currently we are pursuing projects that deal with: enticing intellectual and creative pursuits moderating infooverload instead of contributing mediating people using virtual representatives the assignment problem with the rise of generative ai automatic publishing platforms will pop up everywhere such platforms will no doubt contribute to information overload by constantly generating new content without regard for quality relevance or redundancy this leads to a fragmented information landscape where valuable insights are buried under repetitive or lowvalue posts can we apply the techniques of automated publishing to let substance win over content meaning quality of quantity instead of seeing an automated publishing platform as a content generating machine to continuously grab the attention of users with minimal effort and news and potentially false information we invite you to envision an automated publishing platform that treats its content as tending to a digital garden can such a platform be a rewarding base to return to for users with an interest in a particular topic assignment develop an automated publishing platform that synthesizes curates and refines information to create a dynamic and coherent knowledge base the platform could: aggregate content automatically from various input sources such as rss feeds blogs or news sites then it could identify its relation to a particular topic or target audience and be able to create automated posts instead of continuously creating new posts it could refine old posts or even remove old posts based on new information the system could become a digital garden constantly tended to ensure the information remains relevant and accurate just like wikipedia pages are maintained by its user community you can also explore adding user interaction to refine the platform's curation process and explore how for instance visuals can be generated for the post research opportunities setting up an automated publishing platform using static site generators investigate techniques for automated content generation and curation using modern llm tools and frameworks explore the impact of continuous content refinement on information quality and user satisfaction study user interaction patterns with synthesized content and their contributions to the refinement process as with all projects we invite you to think critically of the possible impact of anything you create expected outcome depending on the experience and interest of the student we envision: a system that uses ci cd and static site generators

contributing mediating people using virtual representatives the assignment problem we have a proofofconcept system that can take a text and peel off layerbylayer different cultural nuances world views perspectives and emotional sentiments until only a core neutral meaningful text remains the system uses the power of large language models (llms) to deconstruct the text as the mathematical power behind text embeddings which allows us to transform the text while keeping its meaning as much the same from the core neutral meaningful nugget we can again build up layer by layer different text representations that convey the same meaning but in completely different representations we can use such a universal translator or transformer of meaning to investigate how people from different perspectives or with seemingly completely different opinions can find common ground in what is essential or how how to explore how you can repackage your message to be accepted or understood by a person with a different cultural social or ideological background this is a very relevant topic in a world where information is twisted into false narratives and information is represented in ways to increase polarization between people instead of bridging the gap assignment depending on the background of the student the aiassisted system behind the universal translator tool can be improved or the student can work on a novel interface design for such a realtime universal translator and transformer several challenges to work on: improving the text deconstruction mechanism (see appendix for current layers) turning the proofofconcept into a professional context of vector and graph databases a system to apply the translator into mediating different opinions creating an appealing and intuitive interface to transform the text realtime research opportunities how to set up the vector and graph databases for storing and analysing the huge text transformations investigate techniques to

reactjs nextjs frontend and incidentally some backend skills you are already familiar with frontend development and would like to not only become a better frontend developer but also expand your knowledge in other directions like python or bash scripting accessibility your project is home of several saas products for the last many years all saas products had their own teams responsible for backend frontend development automated testing infrastructure devops security we already had one designer working on all projects part time to jump in when someone required some ui ux knowledge or design updates this year we're making the saas teams smaller and launch several new vertical miniteams that jump from project to project improving in a very focussed domain this vertical could be summarized as the ""promotion vertical"" you'll spar with the other vertical teams too like the infra devops team for this project we're solving a big problem that most of our saas'es experienced over the years:  improve our accessibility score we'll apply google lighthouse to all pages (using https:  unlighthousedev  for example) and make our frontends shine  improve our visibility to google we're indexed all right but it might need some extra work to make google index us in all of our supported languages as software engineers we're using ci scripts to monitor this and alert us when anything is not ok we verify some keywords that are important to use are indexed by google also we verify that google indexes all languages the saas website offers this provides a matrix of pages to check daily therefore automation is key  consider checking our appearance on other important search engines too for our mostly technical audience duckduckgo is important as well  once the above basics are covered we can go into establishing some analytics using plausible (maybe good to stay away from google analytics privacy wise) and again see if we can wire up scripts that alert us if something bad happens to some metric out of the blue the thing with analytics: no one looks at it on a daily basis so let's push alerts if we need to look at it instead  apply a software engineering mind to seo seo has been known as writing clever text to get on the frontpage of google how can we script our way out of this manual labour of writing tweaking texts can be perhaps use chatgpt for tweaking texts a bit prompt: make this text more readable: works wonders can we also have a seo linter in the ci pipeline that fails the build if anyone tries to merge code that affects seo in a bad way  apply a software engineering mind to adwords automate the tweaking of google adwords campaigns until now it's a manual excercise of excluding certain terms boring let's hope we can do smart things here the company

backend skills you are already familiar with backend development and would like to not only become a better backend developer but also expand your knowledge in other directions like api connection ci bash scripting chatbots human interaction your project is home of several saas products for the last many years all saas products had their own teams responsible for backend frontend development automated testing infrastructure devops security however some saas products are so automated they don't require a dedicated team all the time some other projects need a bit more attention every now and then the decentralized way of dealing with this is obvious we need a bot automating these processes in the beginning of  we've created a pythonbot that's connected to mattermost (our im tool) and gitlab (our code and planning tool) it's current features are:  company roles uses roles for work distribution a single role can be anything from a simple office chore to an employee’s status in a certain development project there are many small tasks in running a company usually people dedicate 90%95% time to their main role which is usually their development project but it’s expected to distribute all smaller jobs across employees too even though some of these roles are optional taking part in them benefits everyone in the company see https:  handbook nl   structure #companyroles  daily planning help every worked who opted in receives a daily im suggesting his her ideal set of tasks for that day the problem is that code gets written but not enough attentions goes to other tasks that don't really work through planned issues it consists of:  handling 1 or 2 client support issues handling 1 or 2 code reviews to give to a collegue (as a result also you get your code reviewed on a daily basis) handling issue discussions that need input (part of backlog refinement you can call it issue review not for simple issues only the tough ones) actual sw development issues for about 6h of workload more and more helpful tasks should be added to the bot like automated sprint planning based on issue priorities peoples interests and skills available time (fulltime parttime work) and so on you'll also get feedback from the team and try to inprove the way the bot works for them as you can see it promotes working asynchronously better we might replace standups sprint plannings retrospectives too (partly or completely) and make the time we need to spend on human interaction more enjoyable (because: our devs tells us they find daily standups boring sometimes) one of the things is schedule quick group meetings based around thorny issues topics that benefit from gathering and discussing it synchronously no more boring or mandatory meetings that are unproductive or boring that's the goal the company we're a team of 20 software developers based in (within the creative industry area ) and remote most of our employees were former students top of their class now

python development skills while working with lots of data you already know some python or at least several other backend languages you're now ready to take it to the next level and would like to become a better software developer your project is the leading cloud based geodata platform where clients use our api to connect their webshop or application with our database of geodata (streets postcodes streetnumbers coordinates and so on) if you live in the  it's pretty certain you've already used our service (unknowingly) when you ordered something online you filled in your postcode and street number so the website would automatically tell you what street and city your parcel will be shipped to every month our 1000 customers that generate many million api calls per day expect an updated dataset including all new addresses in all of our supported countries (nl be de lu fr dk ch and at)you'll be working on the backend api that makes all of this possible the amount of countries supported is rapidly expanding more api requests every day is easy to handle we should be thinking today about the right architecture for the years to come for example: consider a migration from wsgi to asgi rewrite our classes to allow more code reuse between countries your work will consist of rearchitecting the python based platform making it run faster and make code better understandable readable improving our test code coverage (already around 95% for some areas but around 40% for others) add new api call features our customer asked us for typical tools and libraries you'll use for

is coming up: ideal 20 we need to update our payment flow for it of course this included adapting frontend backend and e2e tests  we'd love to extend and improve our already multilingual experience (email website and newsletter language support)  what if our code examples on the website would already contain your personalised api key (when you're logged in) ready to copypaste those kind of tasks

offer a great internship graduation project to improve your reactjs frontend and backend nodejs development skills you are already familiar with either and would like to become a better fullstack developer your project is an open source platform where we allow users to build their own apps in lowcode in our lowcode studio we offer building blocks to configure an app quickly with ease optionally attach datasources to the apps and manage them in a public or private appstore your project deals with improving and extending the lowcode language and the platform itself premade assignment 1: our gui editor allows nontechnical people to build apps using drag drop functionality a working prototype exists but it's far from a completed production version you'll be extending functionality to make the gui editor much more featureful and user friendly see for the actual status and plans:  groups    epics 16 premade assignment 2: even thought about creating your own programming language now you can work on extending our lowcode scripting language to make it practical we'll give you a lowcode app to develop for a real customer usually about 70% of the functionality can be built by the framework already however the remaining 30% of functionality can't be built in lowcode yet because the framework is lacking functionality so 80% of your time is actually spent at improving extending the low code language the missing building blocks in order to deliver the app your remaining 20% of the time will be spent on delivering the actual app in lowcode as proof your additions actually work premade assignment 3: we have a bunch of data sales data from the last few 10 years can you add an ai block to that takes that data makes a prediction about future sales this is an example of how we'd like to approach ai just drag drop your ai prediction block connect it to a data source on the input a graph block on the output presto you just performed magic using ai users would love that now we just have to build it and make it easy for them we have the actual sales data of course however an app that predicts whether you can wear shorts tomorrow based on historic temperature data on your location (you can obtain location in lowcode already) might be a fun example app to show customers what ai can do too there are several ways to influence your project assignment: you can assemble (no pun intended) your own assignment by picking interesting challenges from our issue tracker:  groups    issues sort=updated_desc state=opened you can think about what you want to learn the next 5 months and we'll assemble an assignment that's tailored to your wishes and the needs of the platform to get an example of how your contributions could look like see the results from one of our last semesters' interns:  groups    merge_requests scope=all state=all author_username=ekhorn the company lowcode is not going away we're only seeing more of it and it's projected that in 10 years time 80% of the applications will be nocode or lowcode apps there are several competitors of ours but none of them is open source we feel it's very important to build this open alternative has been developed with the following principles: open source no vendor lockin use of modern standards (pwa reactjs   nodejs docker kubernetes oauth2 jwt jest cypress) an app is built by creating an app recipe in a human readable (yaml   json) format building blocks are chosen and configured here apps should be easy to share copy and customize you should be able to toggle

until now there's not a lot of software solutions were applied previously) your solution allows speech therapists to work more efficient and automate otherwise tedious work we're developing a suite of connected webapplications some are for young end users practicing their pronunication others are for researchers others are for entering data to improve the machine learning algorithms with the kat is a tool that provides more insight into a child's sound development the speech therapist can use analysis overviews to determine the correct treatment goals using the kat the results of naming tasks or spontaneous language can be automatically analyzed to do this you must upload target words with their pronounced realization (use the input sheet for this) the result is an excel file with overviews of known sounds and clusters the applied phonological processes and the words sorted by sound and cluster here's a screenshot of one of the tools you'll be working on where the input is now text but perhaps soon audio (recognised speech) we've developed this tool with researchers from koninklijke auris and have 100 active users the userbase is growing and we need to keep up with bugfixes features and add extra languages to the platform currently we're working together with a german and turkish unversity to also allow multilingual input and practice the codebase is english but the total amount of supported language currently is nl de and tr we're looking to expand further we have a constant focus on improving the user experience we capture this data from live usage and we hold actual user tests from time to time with the speech therapists using the tool so this is one of the research questions you might think of: ""how to improve the usability of the tool and increase speed of user input during a live session to save more time ""depending on your preferred focus it could also be interesting to work on rethinking and restructuring architectural decisions that in hindsight might
